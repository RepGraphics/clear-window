                <p>
                    Welcome to Clear Window. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we handle your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your information.

                    Clear Window provides a platform for verified, anonymous reviews. Our unique approach allows you to share honest feedback while maintaining your anonymity—we verify your connection to the property or service you're reviewing, then immediately anonymize your identity.

                <h2 id="anonymization">4. Our Anonymization Process</h2>
                <p>
                    At the core of Clear Window is our commitment to anonymity. Here's exactly how we protect your identity while maintaining review authenticity:
                </p>

                <h3>Verification Phase (Temporary Data Processing)</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Document Upload:</strong> You upload proof of address or tenancy documentation</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated Verification:</strong> Our system verifies the document authenticity and your connection to the property</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Review (if needed):</strong> Edge cases are reviewed by trained staff under strict confidentiality agreements</li>
                    <li><strong>Verification Complete:</strong> Your connection is confirmed</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Anonymization Phase (Immediate)</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identity Stripping:</strong> All personally identifiable information is removed from your review</li>
                    <li><strong>Document Deletion:</strong> Original verification documents are permanently deleted within 48 hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Hashing:</strong> IP addresses and device identifiers are hashed and separated from review content</li>
                    <li><strong>Pseudonymization:</strong> Reviews are linked to a pseudonymized identifier, not your real identity</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>What Remains Public</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your review content (no identifying information)</li>
                    <li>Your rating</li>
                    <li>Verification status ("Verified Reviewer")</li>
                    <li>General time period of review (e.g., "November 2025")</li>
                    <li>Property/service being reviewed</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What We Can Never Recover</h3>
                <p>Once anonymization is complete, we cannot:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Link your review back to your real identity</li>
                    <li>Reveal your identity to property owners or landlords</li>
                    <li>Share your verification documents with anyone</li>
                    <li>Identify you from the review content alone</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Technical Implementation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our anonymization process uses cryptographic hashing with unique salts, making it computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer identities from anonymized data. This is not obfuscation—it's permanent, irreversible anonymization.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="data-sharing">5. How We Share Your Information</h2>

                <h3>We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Clear Window does not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. Your trust is more valuable than any revenue from data sales.
                </p>

                <h3>When We Share Information</h3>

                <h4>Service Providers</h4>

                    <li><strong>Security services:</strong> To protect against fraud and threats</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment processors:</strong> If we offer paid features (they never see review content)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All service providers are contractually bound to protect your data and use it only for specified purposes.</p>

                <h4>Legal Requirements</h4>
                <p>We may disclose information when required by law or to:</p>
                <ul>

                <h4>Business Transfers</h4>
