                    <li>You represent that your review is truthful, accurate, and based on your genuine experience</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Review Standards</h3>
                <p>All reviews must:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>

                <h3>Review Moderation</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to:</p>

You can delete reviews only before the anonymization process is complete (typically within 24 hours of submission). After anonymization, reviews serve the public interest and remain published indefinitely.</p>

                <p>Property owners, landlords, and service providers have the right to respond to reviews through our verified response system. Responses must also comply with these Terms and our content standards.</p>

                <h2 id="verification">7. Verification Process</h2>

                <h3>Verification Requirement</h3>
                <p>To maintain platform integrity, all reviewers must complete our verification process before their reviews are published. This ensures that reviews come from individuals with genuine connections to the properties or services reviewed.</p>

                <p>You may be required to provide:</p>

                    <li>Documentation showing your connection to the property or service</li>
                    <li>Additional verification information as needed</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Understand that only verification status (not your identity) will be linked to your review</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Verification Rejection</h3>
                <p>We may reject verification and decline to publish reviews if:</p>

                <h2 id="indemnification">12. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>
                    You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Clear Window, its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from:

                <h2 id="dispute">13. Dispute Resolution</h2>

                <h3>Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

                <h3>Informal Resolution</h3>
                <p>Before filing a formal dispute, you agree to contact us at <strong>legal@clearwindow.com</strong> to attempt to resolve the matter informally. We'll work in good faith to resolve disputes within 30 days.</p>

                <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
                <p>
                    If informal resolution fails, you agree that disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except where prohibited by law. Either party may seek injunctive relief in court for intellectual property disputes or breaches of confidentiality.
                </p>

                <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
                <p>
                    You agree that disputes will be resolved on an individual basis only. You waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration, except where such waiver is prohibited by law.
                </p>

                <h3>Exceptions</h3>
                <p>
                    This arbitration agreement does not apply to users in jurisdictions where arbitration agreements are not enforceable (e.g., European Union). Users in those jurisdictions may bring claims in their local courts.
