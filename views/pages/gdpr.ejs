                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Carefully vetted processors who assist with platform operations (hosting, analytics, email services) under strict data processing agreements</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Authorities when required by law or to protect rights, property, or safety</li>
